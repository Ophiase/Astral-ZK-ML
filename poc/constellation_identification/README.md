# Constellation Identification

🏗️ **Work In Progress**

This project simulates star constellations and uses a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to predict the rotational angles (u, v) of a robot's head from a graph of the captured image.

## TODOs
- [ ] Simulate dataset of stars and generate images.
- [ ] Convert images into graph representations (stars as nodes, distances as edges).
- [ ] Implement GAT model to predict rotational angles (`u`, `v`).
