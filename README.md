# Celestial-ZK-ML

Sponsorized by ETH Bruxelles Contest ⚡️

Decentralized Machine Learning Protocol adapted to both terrestrial and spatial context. 
The models and the two smartcontracts utilizing it are written in the ZK-Proovable language Cairo.

## Introduction

- ✅ **ZK-ML tools** : Built in Cairo for contracts on starknet-compatible blockchain
	- Implemented
		- Multi Layer Perceptron (ie. regular Neural Network)
			- eg: Star type identification
	- Not Implemented Yet
		- Convolutional Neural Network
			- eg: Crater identification
		- Graph Attention Network
			- eg: Constellation identification
- ✅ **Decentralized Smart Contracts** : Variants of the smart contract :
	- Fully Decentralized : 
		- Based on financial incentive (ie. egoistic incentive)
		- Terestrial variant adapted to Starknet L2.
	- Country Wise Decentralized :
		- Based on 
		- Spacial variant adapted to a specific L3 for a planet/satellite owned by multiples countries.
- ✅ **Demonstration Client**
    - TODO
